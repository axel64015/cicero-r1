      <h3>A brief summary</h3>

      Virtual reality (VR) is becoming increasingly accessible with developments in technology,
      making headsets and software development more common to meet education and training needs.
      Virtual reality experiences (VRE) are intended to give the viewer a realistic experience inside a
      virtual world, using the technologies to influence the human brain into believing that what they
      are experiencing is real, allowing the impact of the VRE to be that of a seemingly real
      experience.
